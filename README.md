# SkinCancerDetection_ML
Compared the performance of three different classification systems to classify skin lesions as benign or malignant. The first system used Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Logistic Regression, achieving 74.7% accuracy. The second system used a Random Forest classifier with 86.7% accuracy. The third was a Deep Neural Network using PyTorch, which achieved 79% accuracy.
